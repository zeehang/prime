  	<p>Welcome to the new website for prime, the Daily Bruin’s quarterly arts, culture and lifestyle magazine.</p>
  	<p>Since it first hit campus newsstands, prime has provided a space for Daily Bruin staffers to explore stories about UCLA and Los Angeles. The magazine showcases students, faculty and community members; it’s a platform for Daily Bruin editors, writers, photographers, designers and coders to tell their own stories through personal columns or reflective articles. </p>
  	<p>prime pieces vary in tone and style, including features on the future of robotics, profiles on student veterans who write poetry, photo essays on introspective dancers, personal columns on mental health and guides on where to devour the best tacos in Los Angeles.</p>
  	<p>Each quarter, prime publishes a letter from the editors that details what to expect from the latest issue. This letter accompanied the fall 2017 issue of prime:</p>
  	<div class="about-prime__letter">
	  	<p>Dear reader, </p>
		<p>This quarter, we heard stories of students, artists and athletes using their talents as a way to heal — some cope with loss by immortalizing a friend through a tattoo and others by summiting a mountain peak.</p>
		<p>On our campus and in our city, students discover what matters to them through art. In this issue, we see how spoken word can be used to combat society’s “isms” and how revolutionary shows like “Hamilton” provide a stage for people of color to rise up and amplify their voices. Nerdy Bruins can read about niche places around Los Angeles that make them feel at home.</p>
		<p>For some students, self-expression doesn’t come easily. Parents might disapprove of our major or professors might stifle our views in class. But we hope this issue of prime encourages students of all backgrounds and experiences to find a space to tell their stories, embrace their passions and fight to be heard.</p>
	  	<p>prime regards,</p>
