<p>“Nerd,” “geek” and “fangirl” have been insults thrown at me in the past. Now, I
wear the words as badges of honor.</p>
<p>These monikers have a variety of definitions and connotations, but generally,
they’re used to refer to someone with interests outside of mainstream culture.
As someone who has crafted a “Moana” costume from scratch, waited in line for 12
hours for Disney’s live-action film panel at the D23 Expo and written a 30-page
fan fiction to win tickets to “The Lord of the Rings in Concert,” it’s safe to
say I fit squarely within the nerd-geek-fangirl triumvirate.</p>
<p>Los Angeles has a ridiculously spread-out geography, so finding geeky locales
and figuring out if they’re worth the commute has been a constant challenge for
me. I still have a sticky note that I wrote my first year of college, listing
different spots I had read about, cataloging how many minutes away they were.</p>
<p><div class="article__inlineimg left">

<p>I decided to check out a variety of geeky activities that spanned the city to
introduce people to geek culture and new spots in this sprawling city we call
home. These locations range in interest, skill level and location, but all touch
on different aspects of the diverse community of which I am a proud,
card-carrying member – well, I may not have an actual card, but I do have a Time
Travel Passport. That’s got to count for something.</p>
<p><strong>lazRfit</strong></p>
<p><strong>Downtown Los Angeles</strong></p>
<p><strong>400 W Pico Blvd, Los Angeles, CA 90015</strong></p>
<p>Gym culture is not exactly my cup of tea, but I managed to find one location
that brings a geeky element to working out – laser tag.</p>
<p>LazRfit combines exercise with laser tag – once you’re shot, you have to do
enough cardio to reactivate the gear. The gear tracks how many calories you’ve
burned as well as your accuracy, making for an exhausting, but supremely
entertaining, competitive workout. I signed up for a single 50-minute class for
$29, which included a warmup and two separate games.</p>
<p>One of the most striking things about lazRfit is the game course. Gone are the
neon lights and goofy-looking obstacles that characterized most of the laser tag
venues from my childhood. Instead, smooth wooden ramps populate the interior of
lazRfit’s lofted brick building, creating a hipster vibe. You’re also encouraged
to climb and jump over the ramps, which led to some pretty impressive vaulting
(and falling) on my part.</p>
<p>Turning a workout into a game made exercising much more palatable. Although I
had the lowest score and accuracy of everyone in my class, I burned the most
calories.</p>
<p>LazRfit, while expensive, provided a class that was the most fun I’ve had while
burning calories, apart from the time I stayed on the elliptical for three hours
watching the Jeff Sessions testimony on C-SPAN.</p>
<p><strong>Fashion Institute of Design &amp; Merchandising Museum and Galleries</strong></p>
<p><strong>Downtown Los Angeles</strong></p>
<p><strong>919 S Grand Ave, Los Angeles, CA 90015</strong></p>

<p>I haven’t actually seen “The Handmaid’s Tale,” even though I love the book,
which is why I was so surprised when I walked into the Fashion Institute of
Design &amp; Merchandising Museum &amp; Galleries. In the midst of dozens of costumes,
the iconic blood red handmaiden’s dress captured my attention.</p>
<p>The gallery features a rotating selection of fashion and costumes. Winter’s
exhibit is the Annual Art of Motion Picture Costume Design. I went to the Annual
Outstanding Art of Television Costume Design in the fall a few days before the
Emmys to check out costumes from nominated TV shows.</p>
<p>The exhibit included items including Queen Elizabeth’s regal wedding dress from
“The Crown,” as well as Mindy Kaling’s “The Mindy Project” wardrobe, filled with
bright jewel-tone and floral pieces. But they paled in comparison to the
handmaiden’s dress.</p>
<p>“The Handmaid’s Tale” follows the story of Offred (Elisabeth Moss), a woman
struggling to survive in an oppressive, dystopian patriarchy in which women are
designated in different social classes delineated by the colors and dresses they
wear. Moss’ dress has taken on new power off screen because it&#39;s been co-opted
by women’s movements. Political protesters wear it to bring attention to the
inequalities that women face in American society, drawing parallels between
President Donald Trump&#39;s administration and the oppressive regime of the show.</p>
<p>As I stood there, I couldn’t help but feel the immense weight of the costume,
the suffocation, the implications – a piece of fabric gave me chills.</p>
<p>The FIDM Museum &amp; Galleries serves as an emotional stop for any
film-and-television buff, offering a taste of the Hollywood magic we see on
screen.</p>
<p><strong>Time Travel Mart</strong></p>
<p><strong>Echo Park</strong></p>
<p><strong>1714 Sunset Blvd, Los Angeles, CA 90026</strong></p>
<p>The Echo Park Time Travel Mart sits nestled between a vegan ice cream spot and
an independent bookstore-coffee shop, almost blending in with its hipster
surroundings.</p>
<p>You’d be forgiven for thinking that the trendy (read: gentrified) neighborhood
has actually perfected time travel and set up a shop for those giving the
technology a whirl.</p>
<p>Stepping inside is indeed like stepping into a time machine that takes you
straight to a 1970s convenience store – with a twist.</p>
<p>The Time Travel Mart doubles as the storefront for 826LA, a local branch of a
national nonprofit that supports Los Angeles students by teaching them writing
skills. All proceeds from the mart go toward the organization. I also had the
chance to go to the store front for 826 Valencia in San Francisco, which
masquerades as San Francisco’s Only Independent Pirate Supply Store. Look up the
other branches of the charity around the U.S.</p>
<p>LA hosts two locations: an 1870s style general store in Mar Vista and this Echo
Park store.</p>
<p>The shelves feature anthologies of students’ writing in addition to an
assortment of random curios and fun souvenirs, from jars of Time Travel Sickness
Pills (they’re actually mints) to candles dedicated to the so-called patron
saints of time travel, such as Albert Einstein and Stephen Hawking.</p>
<p>However, it’s the store’s immersive nature that’s most fun – the walls are
covered with witty fliers, and two adjacent news tickers share “Tomorrow’s
Headlines” and “Yesterday’s News.”</p>
<p>But if you want to try the Time-Freezy Hyper Slush, you’re out of luck. As the
sign taped to the front of the machine states, it’s “Out of Order, Come Back
Yesterday.”</p>
<p><strong>Geeky Teas</strong></p>
<p><strong>Burbank</strong></p>
<p><strong>2120 W Magnolia Blvd, Burbank, CA 91506</strong></p>
<p><div class="article__inlineimg right">
          <img src="/img/fall17/a_geeks_guide_to_los_angeles/prime.nerdyladguide.geekyteasillo.png" />
          <div class="article__block-imgbox-photo-credit-wrapper">
             <div class="article__block-imgbox-photo-credit-name">Ceci Sheng</div>
             <div class="article__block-imgbox-photo-credit-title">/ daily bruin</div>
          </div>
         </div></p>
<p>Geeky Teas feels like the inside of a fangirl’s head.</p>
<p>The entryway features a life-sized Dalek, directly next to a recreation of
Sherlock’s living room, complete with its flowery wallpaper and spray-painted
smiley face. Although Geeky Teas also houses the GeeKitties Cat Rescue, giving
the store a bit of a random feel, the main draw is the assortment of teas.</p>
<p>I don’t have a particularly discerning taste in tea, but as an amateur
enthusiast and full-time fangirl, I was excited to check it out. The blends take
on creative names chock full of puns, such as “The Brew is Out There” and “Groot
Root Tea.” Even the ingredients of the teas are creative – the “Bad Wolf Tea”
features a rose petal infusion.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, when I went, they were out of most of their flavors, most likely
because it was the same day as one of their craft fairs, but I managed to snag a
bag of their most popular tea, “Green Potion Tea,” a reference to “The Legend of
Zelda.” The fruitier green tea wasn’t that different from other teas I’ve tried,
but the pop culture aspect makes it a worthy novelty, perfect for any nerdy
Brew-in.</p>
<p>Geeky Teas can be overwhelming and definitely won’t be for everyone, but if
you’re looking for the metaphorical version of a fandom dunk tank, this is it.</p>
<p><strong>The One Up</strong></p>
<p><strong>Sherman Oaks</strong></p>
<p><strong>13625 Ventura Blvd, Sherman Oaks, CA 91423</strong></p>
<p>Part bar, part gastrolounge and part arcade, The One Up offers patrons a chance
to eat, drink and play video games – provided they’re of age. The bar stops
admitting anyone under 21 at 6 p.m., which meant I had to go around lunchtime,
when it was almost empty. While this made for a more subdued atmosphere, it made
it easier to try out the games.</p>
<p>The bar and eating area have ample seating, with a space in the back for the
games, which are free for all customers. Most machines have a selection of
classic games to play, from Space Invaders to Donkey Kong, unlike a classic
arcade where separate consoles house each individual game.</p>
<p>I’m no expert, so I tried my hand at the few games I recognized, like Pac-Man
and Galaga, losing almost instantly at both. Although I didn’t have a chance to
try all 440 games in the extensive catalogue, of the games I did play, I ended
up loving a decidedly ’90s shooter game called CarnEvil that allowed me to fire
a shotgun as I enjoyed the campy scariness and jump scares.</p>
<p>Revamped comfort foods like the Cap’n Crunch Fried Chicken &amp; Waffles – chicken
coated in the crushed-up sugary cereal – and herbed parmesan fries were
satisfying, if slightly overpriced. My age prevented me from trying the fun
beverages offered at the bar, like the Grown-up Chocolate Milk and the Brown
Sugar Black Magic.</p>
<p>I’m pretty sure I’m one of the few people that wants to turn 21 just so I can
properly experience The One Up.</p>
<p><strong>The Museum of Jurassic Technology</strong></p>
<p><strong>Culver City</strong></p>
<p><strong>9341 Venice Blvd, Culver City, CA 90232</strong></p>
<p>The Museum of Jurassic Technology may be one of the weirdest, most incredible
places I’ve ever been.</p>
<p>It’s an innocuous-looking building on Venice Boulevard, with a plain stucco
exterior and a small sign advertising the museum. The door opens into a tiny,
brightly lit gift shop. I bought my $5 student ticket and stepped through the
door to the left. I was not prepared for what I found.</p>
<p>The museum contains a collection of seemingly random exhibits, and it’s up to
visitors to find their own meaning in it all – it’s almost like the museum form
of a Rorschach test.</p>
<p>Part of what’s so dizzying about the museum is its TARDIS-like effect – it truly
does seem bigger on the inside, with rooms upon rooms full of bizarre
collections of artifacts, photos, films and audio tracks. Exhibits range from a
portrait series of Soviet dogs sent into space to a photographic timeline of the
life of a Romanian opera singer.</p>
<p>Making sense of it all makes for a psychological and intellectual challenge.</p>
<p><strong>The Perky Nerd</strong></p>
<p><strong>Burbank</strong></p>
<p><strong>1606 W Magnolia Blvd, Burbank, CA 91506</strong></p>
<p><div class="article__inlineimg left">
          <img src="/img/fall17/a_geeks_guide_to_los_angeles/prime.nerdlaguide.perkynerdillo.png" />
          <div class="article__block-imgbox-photo-credit-wrapper">
             <div class="article__block-imgbox-photo-credit-name">Ceci Sheng</div>
             <div class="article__block-imgbox-photo-credit-title">/ daily bruin</div>
          </div>
         </div></p>
<p>I’m all too familiar with the pervasive negativity that characterizes the geek
experience for many women. I have been subjected to rigorous questioning about
lightsaber specifications or been met with disdain about my superhero
preferences, all to discern if I’m a “real fan.” The Perky Nerd constitutes the
antithesis of that culture.</p>
<p>The shop is billed as a female-oriented comic book shop, focusing on
inclusivity. I’m a relative newcomer to the world of comics, so I’ve always been
too intimidated to go to an actual shop, usually buying my comics online or at
Barnes &amp; Noble.</p>
<p>Artwork adorns the walls, showcasing a variety of superheroines. I smiled as I
took in the entire room, from the prominent Wonder Woman display to the various
pieces of artwork featuring Star Wars heroines.</p>
<p>I gathered up the courage to ask if they had the installment after “Thor Volume
1: The Goddess of Thunder.” I felt embarrassed for not knowing the proper
terminology or exactly what I was looking for and apologized profusely to the
woman behind the counter. She smiled reassuringly and told me it was fine,
informing me that they were out of the volume, but would have a new shipment
back next week.</p>
<p>It’s a trek to get out to Burbank, but I’ll be heading back to The Perky Nerd,
both to pick up my copy of “Thor” and to experience the cozy, welcoming
atmosphere of the store all over again.</p>
<p>There is something magical about feeling like you belong, and that’s The Perky
Nerd’s true superpower.</p>
